# Arduino Mega 2560 as our MicroController

1. Chassis used L298N driver motors, 4 DC TT gear motors, and a power supply producing 6.5V with 2.5A.
2. Collection System uses 2xDRV8825 with expansion boards, 2 NEMA 17 Stepper Motors(each motor needs a 1.6A as minimum current to be used)
3. Lifitng Ramp System uses 2xServo Motors that produces high torque(metal gears servo motors)
